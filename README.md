### I am a software dev from Italy
> My professional focus is creating software that is not just functional, but also intuitive and beautiful. The role of proper Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Usability principles is often ignored in the industry, in favor of the advice of so-called design or UX experts. I aim to develop, inform, and assist companies in the path to become the standard in their domain.  
> 
> I focus on the fundamentals: _"Does this feel natural to use?"_, _"Who might struggle here, and why?"_, _"How do we hide complexity without dumbing it down?"_.

> ~ Francesco Gruosso
